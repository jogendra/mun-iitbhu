								<div id="works">
									<div class="work-item">
										<p>The legacy of IITBHU MUN took flight back in 2012, with the desire of bringing the mystical city of Banaras onto the map of the MUN circuit of India, and there has been no looking back ever since!<br> <br> Being in the middle of the Cultural Capital of the country, amidst Asia's largest residential university spanning over 1300 acres, IITBHU MUN has been the ideal location for the conglomeration of passionate debaters and leaders from all around the country. The crisp air over river Ganges, the rising sun on the ghats, the spiritual diversity and the fascinating alleys of Banaras further add to the charisma of this Model United Nations Conference.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="work-item">
										<p>Over the last five years, the conference has seen participation of over 1500(?) delegates and has managed to successfully achieve its aim of initiating constructive debates and deliberations on the most significant issues across the globe. <br><br> With the aim of raising the bar further, IITBHU Model United Nations returns with its 6th edition this year(Date later). Delegates, take note and get ready to Rise. Speak. Resolve!</p>

									<img src="img/committees/munlogo.png" class="pull-left" alt="member">
						       		<p>IIT (BHU) Model United Nations was initiated in 2012, the same year in which the institute was converted from IT to an IIT. In its initial two editions, the conference was held in association with IIMUN, Varanasi Chapter. The 2013 edition was conducted in conjunction with Kashiyatra, the annual cultural festival of the institute.<br>
                        The last three editions have been completely independently organised events. The quality of debating, the standard of the agendas and the expertise of the Executive Board have been raising in standards year by year. A constant rise has been observed in the level of participation from all over the country that includes not only college but school students as well.<br>
 Consistent efforts put in by the organisers have made IITBHU MUN one of the most sought-after event for MUNers across the country.<br>
 So MUNers, mark the dates and be ready for some serious debating, exhausting sessions and a lot of intellectual enrichment.</p>

    <h3>VARANASI: THE CITY OF SPIRITUAL REBIRTH</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>It's often said that arriving in Varanasi can be a little overwhelming. One is greeted by chaos, colour and the feeling of stepping back in time. With its history dating back to 1400B.C., Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities and is dripping in history and spirituality.<br>
Mark Twain in his inimitable prose says: “Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together. I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of the Creation. It was merely an upright “lingam,” at first, no larger than a stove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean. This was the work of the God Vishnu. Later he spread the lingam out till its surface was ten miles across. Still, it was not large enough for the business; therefore, he presently built the globe around it. Benares is thus the centre of the earth.”
</p>
  <h3>THINGS TO DO</h3>
  <hr>
						<p>A boat ride across the sacred Ganges, perfectly captures the spirit of Varanasi. Countless candlelit paper boats with flowers carrying people’s prayers, float their way across the waters. Countless pilgrims take a holy dip in the waters, others meditate in solitude and the rest bow their heads in prayer along the Ghats. As the sun goes down, the evening ritual of worship, called the Ganga Aarti, unfolds.</p>
						<p>Here are a few key things that you must try out while in Banaras:</p>
						<h3>Explore BHU</h3>
						<hr>
						<p>The Banaras Hindu University is an internationally reputed University established in 1916 by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. With a campus, spanning across 1300 acres, and buildings as majestic as forts, it houses a few totally amazing sights you wouldn't expect to find over here, like</p>
						<div><ul class="instUL">
							<li>The Vishwanath Temple, aka VT</li>
							<li>The Bharat Kala Bhawan</li>
							<li>The Trauma Center (state of the art hospital)</li>
							<li>An Airstrip!</li>
							<li>A World War II fighter plane</li>
							<li>A Silver Plated Rolls Royce, to name a few.</li>

					<hr>
					<p>One of the most sacred Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman,  it is said that Tulsidas, (the author of the famous Hindu epic Ramacharitamanas) founded the Sankat Mochan temple.</p>
					<p>Established in the 1970s, the Sankat Mochan festival continues the practice of performance in temples that is today quite rare. Performing in Sankat Mochan – no matter what the performance or who the performer (Muslims perform each year at the festival) – is considered a form of shringar, or “decoration” for the god in question, as well as hazri, or attendance in the god’s court, and shraddha and prem, or respect and love for the god.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>There are temples at almost every turn in Varanasi, but this is the most famous of the lot. Located in the heart of Varanasi, it stands on the western bank of  river Ganges. It is dedicated to Vishveswara – Shiva as lord of the universe. The current temple was built in 1776 by Ahalya Bai of Indore; the 800kg of gold plating on the tower and dome was supplied by Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore 50 years later.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>No single picture can justify the chaotic yet serene beauty of the Ghats. The dream place of every Shutterbug, two of the must-visit ghats are the Assi Ghat and the Dashashwamedh Ghat. Both serve as a wonderful place to linger and people-watch while soaking up the atmosphere. Every evening at 7pm an elaborate ganga aarti ceremony with puja, fire and dance is staged here. With a bit of planning, this can be combined with a boat ride for an amazing experience!</p>
					<img>
					<h3>Explore on Foot</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The narrow lanes crowded with cows, bulls, speeding bicycles is a fantastic experience. One look at the old buildings and you are drawn to its culture and tradition.  It is an adventure plus a lifetime opportunity with a terrific photo chance to passage down these ancient alleys of history. Plus, all the gallis either run towards or parallel to the ghats, so you'd never be lost in this gripping city.</p>

					<p>Approx 10 kms away from Varanasi lies the oldest site museum of the Archeological survey of India. Located right next to the excavated site, this museum has over five galleries and sculptures, artifacts dated from the 3rd Century BC to the 12th Century AD.</p>
					<p>Right across the main hall is Shakyasimha gallery. Here, you can find most special pieces in the museum sandstone Lion Capital of the Mauryan Pillar, which became the national emblem of India. The sites like the Tree where Buddha attained nirvana, the first sermon to his 5 disciples are all fascinating even to a non Buddhist.</p>

  The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even authorize the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security.
The Security Council also recommends to the General Assembly the appointment of the Secretary-General and the admission of new Members to the United Nations. And, together with the General Assembly, it elects the judges of the International Court of Justice.

                The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world’s trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers conduct their business. It is an organization for trade opening, a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements, and a place for them to settle trade disputes. Essentially, the WTO is a place where member governments try to sort out the trade problems they face with each other.

Instead of representing the interests of a single country, the International Press Delegation allows participants to act as unbiased journalists, reporting on the proceedings of each simulation in the Conference. The members observe the simulations in the committees as they unfold and disseminate all the information to all the participants.
